# Azure Samples
The AUM_Scripts contain a few examples.
1. The StartVMs.json/StopVMs.json are used with Azure Update Manager Pre/Post Scripts for Azure Virtual Machines. This use case is to start machines that are stopped prior to patching. Utilize Tags to determine if the machine should only be started, or also stopped at the end of the patching using a post event.
2. The AUM_Set_Tags_True_Submit_PatchAssessment.ps1 script could be used with a Automation Account to schedule monthly patching the day before a maintenance schedule. This would set a tag to PatchMonthly = True. A dynamic scope on a Maintenance schedule would look for machines only with PatchMonthly = True to patch during that month. After the Tag is set, a request is made to access to check for updates.
3. The AUM_Set_Tags_False.ps1 script could be used as Post event script. This script sets the tag PatchMonthly = False after the machines were patched. This would "remove" the machine from a dynamic scope only looking to patch machines that have the tag PatchMontly = True.
